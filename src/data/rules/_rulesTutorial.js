  welcome: [
    `This is 1400 plus. This is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) set in a fantasy world of your choosing.`,
    `You can play this game with any number of people but we recommend between 3 and 7 players. One of you will be the storyteller who is similar to the dungeon master or game master while everyone else roleplays as an adventurer of their own invention.`,
  ],
  storyteller: [
    `In some way the storyteller wears many hats during the adventure. They describe the places you are, they roleplay as the characters your adventurers will meet.`,
    `A storyteller also embodies the dangers you face along the way whether they're monsters, traps, or evil magics. They will throw obstacles in your way to heighten the challenge and make the story more exciting. They're not meant to be an adversary, just to make the story that much more interesting.`,
    `Gameplay generally revolves around the adventurers with the storyteller filling in the details of the world and setting up challenges to overcome. While the storyteller may do things to move the story forward, it's up to the players to move forward and pursue their quests.`,
  ],
  challenges: [
    `Players embody their characters in the game's world. Whenever you'd like to do something, just tell everyone what it is you'd like to do.`,
    `The storyteller will tell you if something is impossible. For example, just stating you'd like to jump to the roof of a ten story building without tools or magic probably won't work.`,
    `If something is possible but challenging you'll a dice for your challenge depending on the type of skill you want to use for it. For example, if you wanted to defeat an animated skeleton with a sword the storyteller will tell you the risks and ask you to roll for melee combat. If you succeed then you destroy the skeleton, if you fail then...`,
    `An important aspect of a challenge is that every challenge has a risk. If there's no risk then there's no need to roll. Not rolling well enough means you suffer the risk's consequences. In the example above, the risk might be that the skeleton injures you with the crude club in its hand.`,
    `The storyteller should always mention the risk when giving you a challenge in addition to the skill you need to roll (for example melee combat like above). The skill determines which dice you roll. If you're not trained in a skill then you roll a d6, if you're hindered or injured you roll a d4, if you're especially well trained you might roll a d12.`,
    `1-2 Disaster. Suffer the full risk. Storyteller decides if you succeed at all.`,
    `3-4 Setback. A lesser consequence or partial success.`,
    `5+ Success. The higher the roll, the better.`,
    `If success can't get you what you want, you'll at least get useful info or set up an advantage.`,
    `The storyteller might increase these numbers for more difficult challenges.`
  ],
  spells: [
    'A spell\'s name describes it. Describe the spell when you cast it and the storyteller determines its limitations.',
    'The storyteller may impose a challenge if the spell presents a risk. This can include overexerting your character\'s magic and being unable to cast the spell for a while.',
    'If the spell has any risk, the roll is Spellcasting',
    'You can disable a spell by clicking the checkmark.'
  ],
  rituals: [
    'A ritual takes ten minutes to cast and uses up a magical supply with the ritual tag.',
    'The blood of a recently killed person, or the sacrifice of a rare animal or plant can be substituted for a magical supply.',
    'You roll a spellcasting challenge to see how successfully you prepared the ritual.',
  ],
  load: [
    `Carry as much as makes sense, but more than one heavy item may hinder you at times.`
  ],
  advancement: [
    `After an adventure, increase a skill by editing your character (none→d8→d10→d12). Your storyteller may award you gold as well (usually d6 to each member).`
  ],
  defence: [
    `Say how one of your items breaks to turn a hit into a brief hindrance. Broken gear is useless until repaired.`
  ],
  harm: [
    `Injuries hinder, and heal with time, magic, or potions. If killed, make a new character to be introduced ASAP. Favour inclusion over realism.`
  ],
  'game mastery': [
    `Lead the group in setting lines not to cross in play. Fast-forward, pause, or rewind`,
    `redo scenes for pacing and safety, and invite players to do likewise. Present dilemmas and problems`,
    `you don’t know how to solve. Move the spotlight to give everyone time to shine. Test periodically for bad luck (e.g., run out of ammo, or into guards) roll d6 to check for (1–2) trouble now or (3–4) signs of trouble.`
  ],
  'custom rules': {
    'ancestries expanded': `Adds additional ancestries for player characters to choose from.`,
    'extended D&D classes': `Adds additional classes based on those found in dungeons and dragons. (Made by Nate)`,
    'draochtlan': `Replaces ancestries to match the custom Draochtlan setting. Cannot be used with other rules that change ancestries. (Made by Nate)`,
